        #       1. create a queue that contains a tuple of the first
        #          component of the workflow and the set of samples
        #          to process
        #       2. pull the first tuple off the queue, get its component
        #          and pass the set of samples to it.
        #       3. When a component is invoked, it processes the set of
        #          samples handed to it and returns a tuple of the next
        #          component to execute and the samples it needs to process
        #       4. This tuple gets added to the queue and we continue
        #          to invoke components and add tuples to the queue until
        #          the queue is empty.
        #       Note: we only add a tuple to the queue if it a) has greater
        #             than zero samples to process and 2) is not already in
        #             the queue. This ensures that the queue eventually

    Operationally, an experiment allows a user to specify the

    workflow. Each mode is associated with a different component.
    Once an experiment's factor modes have all been specified, the
    workflow object creates a workflow that plugs in the correct
    component for each factor.

    This behavior allows the same workflow to contain different code,
    so long as that code produces the same set of outputs from the
    same set of inputs (so, for example, we could use a different
    interpolation scheme in the same workflow).

    Note that one entry ("mode") in the Selector list can be a list of
    components. In this case the listed components will be executed in
    sequence when that mode is selected for the Selector.
